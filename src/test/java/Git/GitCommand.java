	What is a rebase in Git?
	In Git, the rebase command integrates changes from one branch into another. It is an alternative to the better known "merge" command.

	Most visibly, rebase differs from merge by rewriting the commit history in order to produce a straight, linear succession of commits.

	GIT REBASE
	For example, consider a situation where the master branch has progressed since you started working on a feature branch. 
	You want to get the latest updates to the master branch in your feature branch, but you want to keep your branch's history 
	clean so it appears as if you've been working off the latest master branch.

	##Create a new repository on the command line

	touch README.md
	git init
	git add README.md
	git commit -m "first commit"
	git remote add origin git@github.com:alexpchin/<reponame>.git
	git push -u origin master
	
	
	git diff branch1_ branch_2 -to compare two branch
	git diff master filepath - to compare file in two branch
	
	git remove rm origin - to remove origin*/
